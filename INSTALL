INSTALLATION

In principle (on Linux and MacOS X) you should be able to just type

  make

to create excutable versions of the ad and iad programs.  To quickly test
if these are working try

  make test

or

  ./iad -M 0 -q 4 test/vio-A

which processes the file vio-A.rt to produce vio-A.abg.  To install the 
program

  sudo make install

and the binary executable files (iad and ad) will be created and placed in 
/usr/local/bin so that you can use them from any directory 
(if /usr/local/bin is in your path).
